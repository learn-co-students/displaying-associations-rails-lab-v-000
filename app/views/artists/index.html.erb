<!-- This is much better, but to be thorough, let's make one last refactor:
Rails is smart enough to know that if you pass in the post object as an argument,
it will automatically use the ID attribute, so we'll use this implementation code:
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div><%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %></div>
<% end %> -->
<!-- If you open up the Rails console again, you can call the route helpers.
If you have a Post with an id of 3, you can run app.post_path(3) and
see what the resulting output is. Running route helpers in the rails
console is a great way of testing out routes to see what their
exact output will be. -->
